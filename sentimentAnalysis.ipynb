      "as described at the end of Chapter Six, and think o f Him with devotion as he fights. \n",

      "questions and then begins explaining in detail how to know Krsna at the time of death. Since one \n",
      "attains what one remembers at the time of death, if  one remembers Krsna, one goes to Him. Krsna \n",

      "of a leaf, a flower, or some water - if it is offer ed  with devotion. Thus His devotee comes to Him. \n",

    "   In Chapter One and in the beginning of Chapter T wo, Arjuna presents his arguments for refusing \n",

    "Krsna also explains the Vedas' purpose as to gradua lly elevate souls to Krsna consciousness. Krsna \n",
    "thus encourages Arjuna to remain fixed in His servi ce - fight - and ignore his mind's desires. \n",
    "   As Krsna's explanations why Arjuna should fight were only a summary, and since Krsna glorifies \n",

    "therefore opens Chapter Three asking Krsna why He i s encouraging fighting if intelligence is better \n",

    "   Krsna then explains 'karma-yoga', reaction-free devotional work, and clears up Arjuna's mistaken \n",
    "idea that all work is fruitive and leads to bondage . Krsna explains that Arjuna should fight, for \n",
    "avoiding sinful reactions though devotional work is  better than attempting to escape reactions \n",

    "   In the first five chapters, Krsna has explained 'buddhi-yoga', working with consciousness focused \n",

    "God. Arjuna  then points out the main difficulty in  practicing yoga is controlling the mind. Krsna \n",
    "responds by saying that one can overcome the obstin ate mind through constant practice and deter-\n",

    "unsuccessful in his practice will still take birth in a family of wise transcendentalists and \n",
    "automatically become attract yogic principles. Krsn a finally states in the last two verses of the \n",
    "chapter that the yogi is greater than the ascetic, the jnani and the karmi. And the greatest of all yo gis \n",
    "is he who always thinks of Krsna and with grest fai th worships Him in loving  service. \n",
    "   Knowing Krsna's instruction at the end of Chapte r Six, one should initiate his practice of yoga \n",
    "from the point of concentrating of the mind upon Kr sna. Chapter Seven thus opens with Krsna \n",
    "explaining knowledge of Himself and His opulent ene rgies. Thus Arjuna can fully worship Krsna, \n",
    "as described at the end of Chapter Six, and think o f Him with devotion as he fights. \n",
    "   Krsna first explains that as He is the Supreme  Truth, everything in existence is a combination of \n",
    "His material and spiritual energies. He is the acti ve principle within all and is all- pervasive throu gh \n",
    "His diverse material and spiritual energies. Becaus e the world's activities are conducted by the three  \n",

    "those who surrender to Krsna can cross beyond these  modes to know Him. Four kinds of impious \n",

    "Himself from the impersonalists, who are less intel ligent, and from those who surrender to the \n",
    "demigods. But those who are truly pious, the undelu ded, serve Krsna as the governor of the material \n",
    "manifestation, the demigods, and sacrifice, can kno w and understand Krsna - ev the time of death. \n",
    "    Chapter Eight begins by Arjuna asking Krsna abo ut Brahmam, karma, the demigods, the material \n",
    "world, and knowing Krsna at the time of death. Krsn a first briefly answers Arjuna's first five \n",
    "questions and then begins explaining in detail how to know Krsna at the time of death. Since one \n",
    "attains what one remembers at the time of death, if  one remembers Krsna, one goes to Him. Krsna \n",
    "then explains how He can be constantly thought of a s the transcendental person who knows \n",
    "everything, the oldest controller, the smallest, th e maintainer. Thus by pract yoga and remembering \n",
    "Krsna, Krsna explains, one will go to the eternal  spiritual world and never again to return to this \n",
    "temporary, miserable material world. Then, after de scribing the different yogic ways in which one \n",
    "may leave this world, Krsna advises Arjuna not worr y about other paths - either Vedic study, yoga, \n",
    "austere sacrifices, charity, jnana, or karma - for the results of these will all be obtained through performing devotional service. And in the end, such  a yogi in devotion, reaches the supreme eternal \n",
    "abode.   \n",
    "   After Krsna answered Arjuna's questions in Chapt er Eight, He continues speaking, in Chapter \n",
    "Nine, the knowledge about Himself that He had begun  explaining in Chapter Seven. Krsna thus \n",
    "prefaces Chapter Nine by stating that the knowledge  He'll now reveal is most confidential, for it is \n",
    "about His actual position, which only the non-envio us and faithful can understand. Krsna continues \n",
    "explaining that although independent and aloof, He pervades, creates and anihilates the entire \n",
    "cosmos through His material energy. Those mahatmas who know Krsna as the Supreme Personality \n",
    "of Godhead take shelter of Him and serve Him as the  only enjoyer and the supreme object of \n",
    "worship. \n",
    "   Krsna then explains the fortunate position of su ch devotees: If one worships Krsna, Krsna cares, \n",
    "compensates for his deficiencies, and preserves his  strengths. And all Krsna asks for is an offering \n",
    "of a leaf, a flower, or some water - if it is offer ed  with devotion. Thus His devotee comes to Him. \n",
    "Even if a devotee unintentionally commits a horrend ous act, he will be rectified, for Krsna promises \n",
    "that His devotee will never perish. \n",
    "   In Chapters Seven and Nine, Krsna has explained knowledge of His energies. In Chapter Ten, \n",
    "Krsna explains His opulences more specifically and thereby reveals Himself the Supreme \n",
    "Personality of Godhead, the source of all. Krsna al so tells how His pure devotees know that He is \n",
    "the unborn Supreme Lord, the source of all sages, t he source of the material and spiritual worlds, \n",
    "and the source of all qualities and attitudes. Thus  pure and wise devotees worship Krsna, converse \n",
    "about Him, and with thoughts dwelling in Him, undel uded and free from sin, engage in His service. \n",
    "Out of compassion, Krsna within their hearts destro ys any remaining ignorance. \n",
    "   After hearing of Krsna's opulences, Arjuna confi rms Krsna as the Supreme Lord by quoting \n",
    "authorities and explains that only Krsna can truly know Himself. Krsna then tells of His divine \n",
    "manifestations within this world - as the Supersoul , the ocean, the Himalayas - which merely \n",
    "indicate His limitless opulences, for a single frag ment of Krsna's energy pervades and supports this \n",
    "entire universe! \n",
    "   Arjuna, although acknowledging that Krsna in the  two-armed form that he now sees before him is \n",
    "Supreme, still requests Krsna to reveal that all-pe rvading Universal Form that supports the \n",
    "Universe. Thus, in Chapter Eleven, Krsna proves Him self as the Supreme Lord and He establishes \n",
    "the criteria that anyone who claims to be God must also show a Universal Form. Krsna then reveals \n",
    "to Arjuna His wondrous effulgent, all-expansive for m, and Arjuna sees all soldiers on both sides \n",
    "dying within it. Krsna explains His form as time, t he destroyer of all world, and requests that \n",
    "Arjuna, knowing in advance the inevitable d of all the warriors, become His instrument. In answer \n",
    "to Arjuna's fearful prayers, Krsna first shows His four-armed form before again returning to His \n",
    "original two-armed form. Krsna then states that his  two-armed form can only be seen by pure \n",
    "devotees, and such pure devotees, working for Krsna , free from desiring fruitive activities, and who \n",
    "make Krsna the su goal of their lives, certainly co me to Him. \n",
    "   In Chapter Twelve, Arjuna, after witnessing Krsn a's awesome Universal Form, wishes to clarify \n",
    "his own position as a devotee, the highest worshipe r of the Supreme. He thus asks whether wor-\n",
    "shiping Krsna through devotional service or worship ing the impersonal is superior. Krsna \n",
    "immediatly responds saying that one engaged in His personal service is the topmost. One should \n",
    "therefore engage in Krsna's service and fix his min d solely upon Krsna, and, if that cannot be done, \n",
    "one should follow the rules and regulations of 'bha kti-yoga', which purify one so he is later able to \n",
    "do so. Krsna then describes other processes that ev entually lead to His pure devotional service.    Then qualities that endear a devotee to Krsna, w hich Krsna next mentions, such as equality in both \n",
    "happiness and distress, independence from the ordin ary course of activities, satisfaction, and the \n",
    "faithful following of the path of devotional servic e, are also part of the process of worshiping Krsna  \n",
    "in devotional service. \n",
    "    Arjuna opens Chapter Thirteen by inquiring abou t the field of activities and the knower of that \n",
    "field. Krsna answers that the conditioned soul's bo dy and that body's interactions within the material  \n",
    "world are His limited field of activities. By under standing the difference between the body, the soul,  \n",
    "and the Supersoul and by following the process of k nowledge, the soul can transcend the good and \n",
    "the bad he meets, realize his eternal subordination  to Krsna, and attain the supreme destination. \n",
    "   The Thirteenth Chapter clearly explained that by  humbly developing knowledge one can become \n",
    "free from material entanglement. It is also explain ed that the living entity's entanglement within the  \n",
    "material world due to his association with the mode s of material nature (13. 20-22). Now, in \n",
    "Chapter Fourteen, the Supreme Personality of Godhea d, in detail, explains the three \n",
    "modes - goodness, passion and ignorance - those for ces that bind and control all conditioned souls \n",
    "within this world. A soul can, however, transcend t hese modes through devotional service (All other \n",
    "processes are contaminated by the modes). Thus the limitations imposed by his field of activities \n",
    "can be overthrown and the soul can be elevated to t he Brahman platform, the constitutional position \n",
    "of purity and happiness - a platform of which Krsna  is the basis. \n",
    "   As one must be detached from the modes and their  results in order to be attached to the service of \n",
    "the Lord, Krsna describes in Chapter Fifteen the pr ocess of freeing oneself from matter's grip. He \n",
    "begins by comparing the material world to a giganti c, upside-down banyan tree, invoking Arjuna to \n",
    "detach himself from it through surrender. Thus, the  soul can end his transmigrations and return to \n",
    "Him in the spiritual world. \n",
    "   Although the foolish cannot understand that the soul transmigrates, quitting one body to obtain a \n",
    "new body based on his mind's desires, transcendenta lists see this clearly. The foolish can learn to \n",
    "see properly by understanding that it is Krsna who is the splendor of the sun, moon, and fire, as the \n",
    "one keeping the planets in orbit and making vegetab les succulent. They can see Krsna as the fire of \n",
    "digestion; as the Paramatma in everyone's heart; as  the giver of remembrance, knowledge, and \n",
    "forgetfulness; and as the goal of the Vedas and the  compiler of Vedanta. Krsna then reveals that \n",
    "knowing Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead a nd engaging in His service is the ultimate \n",
    "purpose of the Vedanta and the most confidential pa rt of the Vedas. \n",
    "   In Chapter Fifteen, auspicious, elevating activi ties were described as part of the banyan tree. In \n",
    "Chapter Sixteen, after mentioning twenty-six godly qualities, Krsna explains the demoniac nature \n",
    "which degrades the soul through arrogant, ignorant,  and conceited pursuits of sense gratification and \n",
    "power. \n",
    "   Krsna explains the demonic mentality as follows:  The world is unreal and is produced only of sex \n",
    "desire. Taking shelter of lust, they think of sense  gratification as the goal of life and scheme to \n",
    "illegally increase their wealth. While plotting to kill their 'competitor' enemies, they think \n",

    "within the bodies of others, demons blaspheme real religion. These mischievous, lowest amongst \n",
    "men are repeatedly cast by Krsna into demonic speci es to gradually sink to the most abominable \n",

    "demonic life, all sane men should therefore give th em up and understand their duty through faith-\n",

    "of Chapter Seventeen, Arjuna inquires more about th ose who don't follow scriptures, but who \n",
